## Doha Rust (2017-11-18)
I had the pleasure of organizing the first Rust Doha meetup with
Mohammed Makhlouf (@msmakhlouf on Github) and Mohammed Samir (@msamir on Github).

### Serve It With Rust (Gotham tutorial)
In this talk I demonstrated creating a webserver using Rust and Gotham.
I used the git history as a teaching tool. Every commit is a working phase of the project.
